# Titanic-Data-Insight
This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This project showcases my ability to extract meaningful insights from raw data.

### Project Overview
Welcome to this repository! This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights from the data by exploring relationships between various features.

### Task Overview
#### The primary objectives of this project are:
 Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between variables.

### Key Insights
#### Through this project, I have enhanced my skills in:
Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
Data Visualization: Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots and graphs.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Extracting meaningful insights and trends from the dataset.

### Tools and Libraries Used
Python: The core programming language used for analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
